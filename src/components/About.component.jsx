            In dinner party conversation, I dabble in many things from choosing a career in software engineering after spending two years traveling the world, to playing in a Brazilian Samba band, to teaching underprivileged teenagers how to code. In LinkedIn language, I'm a fullstack engineer with a passion for action. Or you can call me Shivani.

            I like to tell stories that complicate things but also excite and connect people.
          </p><br></br>
          <p>
            Iâ€™ve coded for nonprofit organizations, Bose Sound Company, The Company, JP Morgan, The StartupBus, Essense Partners, among others.
          </p><br></br>
          <p>
            I know my way around HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, PHP, Wordpress and frameworks like React and Redux.
          </p><br></br>
          <p>
            I'm based out of Brooklyn, NY and available for frontend engineering, fullstack engineering and great conversation.
