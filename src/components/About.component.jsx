            In dinner party conversation, I dabble in many things from frontend engineering, to hospitality, to cofounding my own company. In LinkedIn language, I'm a freelance frontend engineer with a passion for action. Or you can call me Shivani.
          </p><br></br>
          <p>
            I like to tell stories that complicate things but also excite and connect people.
          </p><br></br>
          <p>
            Iâ€™ve coded for nonprofit organizations, Bose Sound Company, The Company, JP Morgan, The StartupBus, among others.
          </p><br></br>
          <p>
            I know my way around HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and frameworks like React and Redux.
          </p><br></br>
          <p>
            I'm based out of New York City and am available for frontend engineering, fullstack engineering, and great conversation.
